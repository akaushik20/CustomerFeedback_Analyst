Task: Your task is to analyze customer feedback and extract the main themes or topics discussed.
 Given a batch of customer feedback messages,
    produce a JSON array where each item is:
    {
      "id": <string>,
      "theme": <<=5 words, concise, consistent>,

    - Keep theme vocabulary stable across the batch when similar.
    - Prefer business-relevant labels (e.g., "Chime linking errors", "Approval criteria confusion").
    - Ensure themes are distinct and non-overlapping.
    - Make sure the output is valid json and parsable.
    - Do not include any text before or after the JSON array. The output should be only valid JSON array.
    - If feedback is empty, return an empty list."""

3. Joined Dataset - combines feedback and usage per customer

You must:
- Identify 4 to 5 actionable recommendations
- For each recommendation, include a detailed rationale
- Support your rationale with observed trends, frequencies, and relevant data patterns
- Highlight customer pain points, opportunities, or product improvement ideas
- Avoid generic suggestions â€” focus on specific, data-backed insights

Instruction: 
Use all three datasets in context. Refer to trends over time, repeated themes, or correlations between feature usage and customer sentiment. Be concise, analytical, and outcome-driven.
