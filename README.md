# Customer Feedback Analyst

A Streamlit-based app that analyzes customer feedback, extracts key themes using LLMs, joins with product usage metrics, and provides actionable recommendations using LLM.

## ‚ú® Problem Framing & Assumptions

### Problem
Businesses receive qualitative customer feedback and quantitative product usage logs. Analyzing both together is essential but time-consuming.

**Goal**: Build an AI-powered system that:
- Extracts consistent, short themes from unstructured feedback.
- Quantifies trends in sentiment and theme frequency.
- Joins with product usage to surface data-backed insights.
- Outputs recommendations with rationale.
